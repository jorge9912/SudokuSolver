# SudokuSolver

Formulated Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem, and the implemented the backtracking algorithm to solve.  In this project, there are optimizations made to the backtracking algorithm, as well as graphical analytics of the solvers time to solve with respect to numbers initially filled out in the puzzle
